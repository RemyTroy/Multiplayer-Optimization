This project is currently in development, and this README will serve as a brief guide on what is being worked on, the current status, and the planned next steps.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Under Construction** ðŸš§

I have just started working on this project over the last few months and with work and school I am slowly building it up so with that said, it's in its early stages. The basic structure is in place, but there's a lot more to be done to achieve the final vision.

## Current Features

- Simulated multiplayer game networking optimization.
- Basic client and server interactions.
- Player input handling and game state updates.

## Next Steps

The next steps for this project include:

1. **Implementing Advanced Networking Techniques:**
   - Explore and implement more advanced networking techniques, such as efficient game state updates and synchronization.

2. **Lag Compensation:**
   - Research and incorporate lag compensation techniques to mitigate latency-related issues.

3. **Client-Side Prediction:**
   - Introduce client-side prediction to enhance responsiveness and player experience.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement security measures to ensure a robust networking solution.
